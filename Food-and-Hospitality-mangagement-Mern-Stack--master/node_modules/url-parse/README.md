**`url-parse` was created in 2014 when the WHATWG URL API was not available in
Node.js and the `URL` interface was supported only in some browsers. Today this
is no longer true. The `URL` interface is available in all supported Node.js
release lines and basically all browsers. Consider using it for better security
and accuracy.**

The `url-parse` method exposes two different API interfaces. The
[`url`](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html) interface that you know from Node.js
and the new [`URL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL)
interface that is available in the latest browsers.

In version `0.1` we moved from a DOM based parsing solution, using the `<a>`
element, to a full Regular Expression solution. The main reason for this was
to make the URL parser available in different JavaScript environments as you
don't always have access to the DOM. An example of such environment is the
[`Worker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Worker) interface.
The RegExp based solution didn't work well as it required a lot of lookups
causing major problems in FireFox. In version `1.0.0` we ditched the RegExp
based solution in favor of a pure string parsing solution which chops up the
URL into smaller pieces. This module still has a really small footprint as it
has been designed to be used on the client side.

In addition to URL parsing we also expose the bundled `querystringify` module.

## Installation

This module is designed to be used using either browserify or Node.js it's
released in the public npm registry and can be installed using:

```
npm install url-parse
```

## Usage

All examples assume that this library is bootstrapped using:

```js
'use strict';

var Url = require('url-parse');
```

To parse an URL simply call the `URL` method with the URL that needs to be
transformed into an object.

```js
var url = new Url('https://github.com/foo/bar');
```

The `new` keyword is optional but it will save you an extra function invocation.
The constructor takes the following arguments:

- `url` (`String`): A string representing an absolute or relative URL.
- `baseURL` (`Object` | `String`): An object or string representing
  the base URL to use in case `url` is a relative URL. This argument is
  optional and defaults to [`location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location)
  in the browser.
- `parser` (`Boolean` | `Function`): This argument is optional and specifies
  how to parse the q
